# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This workspace hosts content for Zenn. Manuscripts live under `articles/` as Markdown files with YAML front matter; keep the slug-style filename generated by the Zenn CLI. Long-form compilations belong in `books/`, organised per chapter within directories. `README.md` surfaces quickstart commands and should mirror the latest workflow updates. `node_modules/` is pnpm-managed; never commit it.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `pnpm install` to sync dependencies before editing. Use `pnpm zenn new:article` and `pnpm zenn new:book` to scaffold content with correct metadata. Preview drafts locally via `pnpm zenn preview`, which launches the Zenn preview server at http://localhost:8000; restart if front matter changes fail to appear. The default `pnpm test` script is a placeholder—extend it only after adding automated checks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write Markdown in UTF-8 with a trailing newline. Keep each Markdown file starting with Zenn-required front matter, for example:
```md
---
title: "Example Title"
emoji: "✍️"
type: "tech"
topics: ["zenn", "markdown"]
published: false
---
```
Use lowercase kebab-case for topics and keep filenames stable after publication to preserve URLs. Favour descriptive headings (H2/H3), fenced code blocks with language hints, and link relative assets from `/articles` when possible.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated suite today; rely on the preview server to validate rendering, code fences, and link integrity. Before publishing, check for broken images, lint Markdown with `pnpm dlx markdownlint-cli "articles/**/*.md"`, and confirm code snippets compile or run where practical.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow Conventional Commit subjects (`type(scope): summary`) to keep history searchable, mirroring popular open-source practice. Each pull request should explain the purpose, list visible changes, and link related Zenn articles if updating live content. Include before/after screenshots or preview URLs for styled components, and request review whenever content or tooling impacts production publishing.

## Content Publishing Checklist
Before merging, confirm metadata completeness (title, emoji, type, topics) and update `published: true` only after editorial approval. Ensure Japanese/English mixed content tracks the style rules noted in article templates and run spell-check on both languages.
